# cachetur-bookmarklets
Bookmarklets to allow adding geocaches to cachetur from a browser. Works from Geocaching.com Cache Details page as well as their Map view page. 

MAY 2019: added support for geocaching.com new map (except for showing route). Added support for Project-GC maps. Added ability to draw route over map, add comment and priority after adding a cache to a route. Verify user is logged in to avoid odd behaviors.
